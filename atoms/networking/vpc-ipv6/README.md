# Challenge: Create a single VPC with IPv4 and IPv6 CIDIR blocks

## Problem description

Create a VPC with IPv4 and IPv6 CIDIR blocks, abided by following [Common context](../../../README.md#common-context):
  * Single account compliance.
  * Resource tagging compliance.
  * AWS Region compliance.

The solution must be generic enough to be reused.

## Solutions

- Cloudformation

Refer to [solution.md](/docs/solution.md) for how to run the solutions.

## What we learn

* [The IPv6 CIDR block size is fixed at /56](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpccidrblock.html#:~:text=The%20IPv6%20CIDR%20block%20size%20is%20fixed%20at%20/56),
and the IPv6 CIDR block is generated by AWS, we cannot specify it.

* Cloudformation exported values can be reused by other Cloudformation templates in same Account and Region.
